# Registry Proxy Recommendations

To help secure your Kyma cluster and protect access to private container registries, follow these recommendations.

## Exclude NodePort Range From VPC Peering Routes

The Registry Proxy module uses the Kubernetes NodePort service, accessible on ports 30000-32767 from all cluster nodes.
If an attacker compromises the cluster network, they can use the NodePort service to potentially gain access to the private registry (provided they have the credentials to access it).
You can mitigate this risk by excluding the NodePort range (30000-32767) from VPC Peering Routes.
