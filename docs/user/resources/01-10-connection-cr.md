# Connection

The `connections.registry-proxy.kyma-project.io` CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) is a detailed description of the kind of data and the format used to manage **Connections** within Kyma. It facilitates establishing a connection to a target container registry through the Connectivity Proxy. 

To get the up-to-date CRD in YAML format, run:

```bash
kubectl get connections.registry-proxy.kyma-project.io -A -o yaml
```

## Sample Custom Resource

The following `Connection` object creates a connection to a target registry through the Connectivity Proxy. `proxyURL` specifies the Connectivity Proxy's URL. `targetHost` defines the target registry's host.

```yaml
apiVersion: registry-proxy.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
kind: Connection
metadata:
  name: registry-proxy-example
spec:
  proxyURL: "http://connectivity-proxy.kyma-system.svc.cluster.local:20003"
  targetHost: "myregistry.kyma:25002"
  logLevel: debug
```
