# Registry Proxy

The `registryproxies.operator.kyma-project.io` CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) describes the data and the format used to manage **Registry Proxies** within Kyma. It facilitates the configuration and management of the Registry Proxy service, which acts as a proxy between the Kyma cluster and external container registries. To get the up-to-date CRD and show the output in the YAML format, run this command:

```bash
kubectl get registryproxies.operator.kyma-project.io -A -o yaml
```

## Sample Custom Resource

The following `RegistryProxy` object represents a proxy configuration for connecting to a target container registry through the Connectivity Proxy. The `status` field provides information about the state, served status, and conditions of the Registry Proxy.
```yaml
apiVersion: registry-proxy.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
kind: RegistryProxy
metadata:
  name: registry-proxy-example
spec: {}
```

## Custom Resource Parameters
